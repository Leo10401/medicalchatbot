Based on what you've shared, it's possible that you might be experiencing a viral or bacterial infection. However, I want to emphasize that I'm not a doctor, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThat being said, I can try to provide some general information that might be helpful. Cough, headache, and vomiting can be symptoms of various conditions, including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal issues, or even something like malaria, which is characterized by symptoms like chills, vomiting, high fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle pain.\n\nTo better understand what might be going on, can you tell me more about your symptoms? For example, how long have you been experiencing them, and have you noticed any other symptoms like fever, fatigue, or body aches? Additionally, have you recently traveled to any areas where you might have been exposed to certain illnesses? Any information you can provide will help me give you more tailored guidance and support.",
